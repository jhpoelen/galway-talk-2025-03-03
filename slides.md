## Research Data In the Wild

> While walking the land, I am the pen on the paper; while drawing this map, my pen is myself walking the land. I wanted to short circuit the polarities of objectivity and subjectivity, and try keep faith with reality.  – Tim Robinson

## Internet Is Designed For *Exchanging* Information 

> The internet is a powerful tool for exchanging digital information. But the Internet’s contents changes constantly: websites are launched and taken down, webpages change, and content gets archived or lost.^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L12](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L12)]

## Internet Is *Location-based*

> By design, a web address, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), points to a specific internet location from which a resource, like a webpage, can be retrieved. However, a URL does not provide a way to verify that a retrieved webpage was the one we asked for. ^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L14](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L14)]

## Finding Content By Their Location Is ... Tricky

> Imagine using a URL-like reference to find a book at a library: instead of locating a book by what it is (e.g., title, author), you refer to a book by its location (e.g., third shelf on the second row next to the window). With this, a book becomes unfindable if moved to another shelf. And, if you do manage to find a book at the referenced location, how would you know you’ve found the book you are looking for? ^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L16](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L16)]

## Finding Content By Their (Summarized) Content Is ... What Librarians Do

> Instead of pointing to where books are located, librarians point to them using a bibliographic reference. For practical reasons, only a few identifying clues are included in such a reference (e.g., author, year of publication, title, and publisher). **So, librarians refer to content by what it is, and knowing where it may be located is secondary.** ^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L18](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L18)]
